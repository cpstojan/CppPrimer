Explain the key differences between pointers and references.

pointers
-are an object
-can be reassigned or copied
-there exists pointer arithmetic
-can be uninitialized

references
-do not exist in memory
-alias another object and don't have an address of their own
-can not be modified once created
-must be initialized
