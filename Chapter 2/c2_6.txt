What, if any, are the differences between the following
definitions:
int month = 9, day = 7;
int month = 09, day = 07;

The first line both definitions are valid and deoimal.
In the second line the first definition is not valid as it is octal and octal does not contain the digit 9.  The second definition is also octal but is valid.
