What are the differences between int, long, long long, and short? Between an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

An int is at least as large as a short or larger.  A long is as at least as large as an int or larger.  A long long is at least as large as a long or larger.  C++ guarantees short and int are at least 16 bits, long is at least 32 bits and long long is at least 64 bits.

Signed types can represent both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero.  Unsigned can only be positive or zero numbers.

Neither the C nor the C++ standards specify the representation of float, double and long double.  It is possible that all three are implemented as double-precision (64 bit).  Nevertheless, in most architectures (gcc, MSVC; x86, x64, ARM) float is indeed a single-precision floating point number and double is a double-precision floating point number.
