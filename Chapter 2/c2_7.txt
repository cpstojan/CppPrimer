What values do these literals represent? What type does each
have?
(a) "Who goes with F\145rgus?\012" This is a string literal with \145 being e and \012 being a new line
(b) 3.14e1L This is a long double with value 31.4
(c) 1024f This produces an error as the suffix is only valid with floating point literals
(d) 3.14L This is a long double with value 3.14
