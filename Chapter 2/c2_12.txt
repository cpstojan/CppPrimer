Which, if any, of the following names are invalid?
(a) int double = 3.14; // not valid, can't use double as an identifier
(b) int _; // valid
(c) int catch-22; // not valid, can't use hyphens (only alphanumeric and underscore)
(d) int 1_or_2 = 1; // not valid can't start with a digit
(e) double Double = 3.14; // valid, but probably shouldn't
