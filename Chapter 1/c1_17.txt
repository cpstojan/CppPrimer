What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are all equal? What if there are no duplicated values?

If input values are all equal the program will only print out one line once the EOF has been reached.  Nothing will be printed until this point.

If there are no duplicated values then after each value a line will be printed.  This pattern will continue until EOF.
