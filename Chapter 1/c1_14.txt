Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

For loops tend to be more concise when doing something with a counter.  Also having the counter only exist within the for loop can have an advantage (scope).

While tends to be more useful when the number of iterations is not known.
