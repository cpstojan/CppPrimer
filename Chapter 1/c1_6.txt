std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
<< " and " << v2;
<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

The above statement is not legal.  This is due to the second and third lines not having a left hand operand of type ostream.
This statement could be fixed in two ways shown below.

v1

std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
std::cout << " and " << v2;
std::cout << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;

v2

std::cout << "The sum of " << v1
	<< " and " << v2
	<< " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
