Chapter 1 Notes
-the primary goal of the new standards of C++ (C++11) are to increase uniformity, make the standard library easier, safer and more efficient, and to make it easier to write efficient abstractions
-new features include auto, smart ptrs, and move-enabled containers

function - named unit of computation
main - function called by the operating system to execute a C++ program, each program must have one and only one function named main
-a function definition has four elements: return type, function name, parameter list and function body
-the value returned by main is a status indicator, usually a value of 0 indicates success, non zero has meaning define by the system (type of error)
-a type defines both the contents of a data element and the operations that are possible on that data
-the data our programs manipulate are stored in variables and every variable has a type
source file - term used to describe a file that contains a C++ program
-to obtain the status on Unix systems use the command echo $? 
-on Unix executables have no suffic (on Windows suffix is .exe)
-options can be added to the GNU compiler an example is -Wall which generates warnings about problematic constructs
-to create an executable on GNU g++ -c prog1 prog1.cc
-then to run the created executable (assuming permissions) ./prog1
